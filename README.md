# Vehicle Population Analysis System

## Overview
A Python program that analyzes vehicle population data in Singapore for different types of vehicles over 2012. The program allows users to:

- View vehicle population for Taxi for all months in 2012.
- Calculate the mean of the second half of the year and list months exceeding the mean for a selected vehicle type.
- Identify months with population increases of more than 3% compared to the previous month.
- Visualize trends using line and bar plots.

Built using Python, CSV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, this program provides an interactive, menu-driven interface for analyzing vehicle population trends.

## Technologies Used
Python • CSV • NumPy • Matplotlib • Data Analysis • Data Visualization

## Features
- Display monthly vehicle population for Taxi.
- Calculate and compare population means for selected vehicle types.
- Detect months with significant population increases.
- Generate line plots and bar charts for population trends.
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.

## How It Works
1. Reads vehicle population data from a CSV file (`mvehpop_dataset.csv`).
2. Displays a menu for the user to choose an operation.
3. Performs calculations and comparisons using NumPy.
4. Generates visualizations with Matplotlib to show trends.
5. Provides insights on months with significant increases or deviations.

## How to Run

1.Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your computer.

2.Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

3.open cmd with win + r, choose a directory and create a folder.

4.go to the project directory.

5.clone the project on a new terminal with
```bash
https://github.com/Pythonista-dev-cyber/Vehicle-Population-Analysis-System.git
```
and type code . to open vs code

6.run the python file and follow screen menu
